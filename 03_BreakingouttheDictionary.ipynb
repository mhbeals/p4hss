    "\n",

If you have hundreds of these cards, each with a different key, you can place them in a single box.  That box is the dictionary and each card is a two-value list within it.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if we want to know how often a particular ngram appears in the larger text, we can make a list of all the different (unique) ngrams with each with its own tally of instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll need to split our strings into a word list and transform it into an ngram. Do this by running the concordance software we created last time (below) changing the variables as apprporiate to whichever text you'd like to work with first."

    "\n",
    "Look familiar? Just like you can use and index number to access a particular letter in a string or an item in a list, you can use a *key* to access a certain entry in a dictionary. So, if, for each ngram in your ngram list, you wanted to add a new value, you would just use\n",
