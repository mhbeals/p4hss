If we use a longer passage, such as the first chapters of \"A Tale of Two Cities\", we will need to do a bit more prepatory work.\n\nSo, let's try that again but with a bit more grace.  First, we'll need to import the `re` library, short for Regex, or Regular Expressions. This library provides new functions for finding and replacing text in your dataset. \n\nTo import a standard Python library, you need only use the command `import` followed by the library name, in this case `re`. Import the library below."

On the subsequent line, you'll need to use the function `re.sub()` to remove the punctuation marks.  A simple (if slightly blunt) way of doing this is through negative critera.  \n\nWe'll use three standard *regular expressions*\n\n+ `[]` &mdash; putting a regular expression in square brackets indicates it should search for any of the items within it\n+ `\\w` &mdash; any word\n+ `\\s` &mdash; any whitespace\n+ `^` &mdash; not\n+ `*` &mdash; 0 or more times\n\nto create the expression `[`^\\w^\\s`]*`, which translates to \"find anything that is not a word or a whitespace zero or more times\". You need the \"zero or more times\" in case there are two punctuation marks together.\n\nWe then place this in the `re.sub(x, y, z)` funciton, where \n\n+ x is the regular expression, \n+ y is what you want to replace it with in single quotation marks (in this case nothing, or `''`)\n+ z is the name of the string you are transforming.\n\nIn the box below, on the second line, reassign `my_string` to the `re.sub()` function, replacing x, y, and z as appropriate.\n\nUse a truncated print command&mdash;`print(my_string[0:100])`&mdash;to see if your transformation was successful."

There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the  throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with  a fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer  than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes,  that things in general were settled for ever.    It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.  Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured period,  as at this. Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her five-and-twentieth  blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had  heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were  made for the swallowing up of London and Westminster. Even the Cock-lane  ghost had been laid only a round dozen of years, after rapping out its  messages, as the spirits of this very year last past (supernaturally  deficient in originality) rapped out theirs. Mere messages in the  earthly order of events had lately come to the English Crown and People,  from a congress of British subjects in America: which, strange  to relate, have proved more important to the human race than any  communications yet received through any of the chickens of the Cock-lane  brood.    France, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her  sister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness down  hill, making paper money and spending it. Under the guidance of her  Christian pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such humane  achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off, his tongue  torn out with pincers, and his body burned alive, because he had not  kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks  which passed within his view, at a distance of some fifty or sixty  yards. It is likely enough that, rooted in the woods of France and  Norway, there were growing trees, when that sufferer was put to death,  already marked by the Woodman, Fate, to come down and be sawn into  boards, to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in  it, terrible in history. It is likely enough that in the rough outhouses  of some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to Paris, there were  sheltered from the weather that very day, rude carts, bespattered with  rustic mire, snuffed about by pigs, and roosted in by poultry, which  the Farmer, Death, had already set apart to be his tumbrils of  the Revolution. But that Woodman and that Farmer, though they work  unceasingly, work silently, and no one heard them as they went about  with muffled tread: the rather, forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion  that they were awake, was to be atheistical and traitorous.    In England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to  justify much national boasting. Daring burglaries by armed men, and  highway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night;  families were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing  their furniture to upholsterers' warehouses for security; the highwayman  in the dark was a City tradesman in the light, and, being recognised and  challenged by his fellow-tradesman whom he stopped in his character of  “the Captain,” gallantly shot him through the head and rode away; the  mail was waylaid by seven robbers, and the guard shot three dead, and  then got shot dead himself by the other four, “in consequence of the  failure of his ammunition:” after which the mail was robbed in peace;  that magnificent potentate, the Lord Mayor of London, was made to stand  and deliver on Turnham Green, by one highwayman, who despoiled the  illustrious creature in sight of all his retinue; prisoners in London  gaols fought battles with their turnkeys, and the majesty of the law  fired blunderbusses in among them, loaded with rounds of shot and ball;  thieves snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at  Court drawing-rooms; musketeers went into St. Giles's, to search  for contraband goods, and the mob fired on the musketeers, and the  musketeers fired on the mob, and nobody thought any of these occurrences  much out of the common way. In the midst of them, the hangman, ever busy  and ever worse than useless, was in constant requisition; now, stringing  up long rows of miscellaneous criminals; now, hanging a housebreaker on  Saturday who had been taken on Tuesday; now, burning people in the  hand at Newgate by the dozen, and now burning pamphlets at the door of  Westminster Hall; to-day, taking the life of an atrocious murderer,  and to-morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer's boy of  sixpence.    All these things, and a thousand like them, came to pass in and close  upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.  Environed by them, while the Woodman and the Farmer worked unheeded,  those two of the large jaws, and those other two of the plain and the  fair faces, trod with stir enough, and carried their divine rights  with a high hand. Thus did the year one thousand seven hundred  and seventy-five conduct their Greatnesses, and myriads of small  creatures--the creatures of this chronicle among the rest--along the  roads that lay before them.\"\n",

Nobody, that's who.  So instead you'll need to learn how to open files that are already on your computer.  In the directory you closed, I included a full copy of a *A Tale of Two Cities* as `taleoftwocities.txt`. You can easily open and import the data from a file in the same directory using the `.read()` function:\n\n    with open('filename.txt', 'r') as filename:\n        data = filename.read()\n        \nLet's break that down. The first line is commanding the console to open a file called `filename.txt` in `r` or read mode. It is then creating a temporary variable called filename to store that information in.  We then just assign that information to a new string called data. \n\nYou have to use the function `.read()` because just assign `filename` would give you, in essence, the metadata about that file, rather than data itself.\n\nTry importing *A Tale of Two Cities* into a variable and then printing the first 500 characters.\n    "
