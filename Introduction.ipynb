Click on the grey box below this one and press **RUN** at the top of your screen.\n\n## The Jupyter Notebook\n\nThis is a Jupyter Notebook. It allows you to practice and prototype your code in a cloud environment (rather than directly on your computer) and to document your work through text boxes above and below each section of code.\n\nThe grey boxes below are all Python code boxes. If you type your code within them, you can run each one in turn. It is important to remember that although this is one big notebook, you must run each box separately (and in order) for the lesson to make sense.\n\nIf at any point the In [1] next to your grey box becomes stuck as In [*], hit the refresh (circular arrow) button at the top of the screen and begin again.\n\nSo, let us introduce ourselves and practice using the notebook! Click on the grey box below this one and then press the Run button at the top of your screen. When the questions appear, answer each one in turn."

In Python, these are always enclosed in quotations marks (either ' ' or \" \"). They can include any character—a letter, a number or a symbol!\nThere are many other types of variables you can use. The most common are:\n\n+ str (strings of letters, numbers and other characters)\n+ bool (true or false, usually written as 0 and 1)\n+ int (signed integers, such as 1 and -1)\n+ long (long integers, for really, really big numbers!)\n+ float (floating point real values, such as 3.14)\n+ complex (complex numbers)\n\nNormally, Python will guess which type of variable you are creating based on the contents. If you wanted to create a string variable called name with the value \"John\", you could just type\n\n`name = \"John\"`\n\nFor numbers, you should not use quotation marks. For example\n\n`myint = 1\nmybool = 0 \nmyfloat = 3.14`\n\nWhatever you name your variables, make sure there are no spaces of special characters. If you want you can use _ as a space, as above.\n\nLet's try a few now! In the box below, create 3 variables—a string, a bool and an integer—each on a separate line within the box. When you are done, run the code by hitting the run button or (even easier) hitting cntl+enter on your keyboard. This will store your variables in memory.\n\n*Note:* a bool can be either true or false or 1 or 0"
