To do this we will be using the incredibly powerful (and prolific) library *matplotlib*.  The important thing to remember is that this is only one tiny example of what this library can help you achieve&mdash;the only limit is your imaginiation. Let's begin, however, by reviewing our data.\n\nIn order to make an effective visualisation, we'll need some good quality data.  Our end goal is to have a dataset (namely a dictionary) in the following format:\n\n    x: [a, b, c, d, e]\n    \nwhere `x` represents a word in our text and `a-z` represent the index numbers of that word, or rather, the numerical representation of where that word appears in our text.  This will allow us to make a heatmap of the entire book, with coloured stripes at each appearance.  \n\nSo, were do we begin? Let's think about this backward.  To get a dictionary of all words and their apperance in the text, we'll first need to have a list of all the words in the text.\n\nWe'll also need to have that list regularised, to remove punctuation and casing.\n\nOf course, we'll also need the text itself, which means downloading a new book from Gutenberg and formatting it as a string and removing the headers. May I suggest http://www.gutenberg.org/files/37750/37750.txt?\n\nIs there anything I'm forgetting? Oh, yes! as a English text, there will be many (many) prepositions and articles that are not really that interesting for this particular visualisation, so we'll need to use a list of English *stop words* to help us focus our results.\n\nWith that review in mind, use the box below to:"

      "source": "Perfect! Now we need to make the dictionary we described above. So, let's think about what we need:\n\n    word: [a, b, c]\n    \nCreating a dictionary of words is pretty straight forward! We just need to go through our list of words and add each unique one to the dictionary. But what about the list of instances?  That's not as simple as just \"adding 1\" like we did last time.\n\nInstead, we'll need to create a new list for each *value*.  Remember, a value can be anything, a *string*, an *integer*, a *list*.  So, let's start with a new list, called list.\n\nNext, we'll need to determine if a list for that word already exists.  To do this, we'll assign the value of that key (using the *get* command) to a new variable, called entry.\n\nNow, our entry might be empty, so we'll have to test for that.  *If* it has no value (if entry == None), then it is just a matter of assiging a new list with that index number to that key.\n\nIf it's not (use the else command), we'll have to `.append()` the index number to the existing *entry* list before assiging *entry* to the key.\n\nOh wait! How do we get the index number?  There are many ways to go about that, but perhaps the easiest is just to keep track of which word we are on with a simple *i* variable.  Because we want to know the word number, lets set *i* as 1 rather than zero and after each loop throught the word list increment *i* by one.\n\nTry out your code below:"

We can do this by making a bar chart where all the bars are the same height (lateral thinking!)\n\nSo what information do we need to do this. First, we need to know what the most common word(s) in our word list are.  We have a dictionary of every work and a list of all the instances of it.  By going through our dictionary and using the *len* function, we can determine which one has the larger list (the most instances).  \n\nLet's start with the assumption that at least 1 word as at least 1 instance.  So create a *value* variable with a value of 1, then go through our whole dictionary (using a for loop and the `.items()` function) and check if the length of each list is bigger or smaller than our starting value. If it is, change the value of *value* to the new length (otherwise do nothing). At the end of our loop, value will be an integer representing the longest list in your dictionary.  Use the print command to find out what it is."

Now, we don't want to make each bar individually (that would take too long!)  Instead, make a small for loop to automatically populate your five words.\n\n+ create a for loop to go through your top five words\n    + go through every word in your dictionary\n        + if the word in the dictionary is the same as your word in the top five list\n            + create a bar\n            \nThat bar should use variables! So instead of the *x*, use the list (value) in your dictionary and the label should be your word (key). You can make *y* whatever you like, but I would suggest 1 for simplicity sake. You'll also probably wnat to add a `width=10`.  Remember, your text could be tens of thousands of words long, so a single line might be impossible to see!\n\nWhat about the `xlim`?  Remember when we checked for the wordcount of our whole document?  That seems good length for the x-axis.\n\nYou can also use blank lists for the `xticks` and `yticks`.  You don't need them!\n\nOnce you've titled your chart and placed your legend, run your code below."
